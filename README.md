I'm kind of sick of Rails authentication stacks that try to be all things to all people,
except in one little area where their authors are stubborn and opinionated.

So I thought I'd build another one.

Goals
-----

* Works out of the box
* ...with Rails 2 *and* 3
* ...and any ORM (within reason)
* ...as modularly and unobtrusively as possible

Ungoals
-------

* Flexibility for flexibility's sake
* Endless configuration options
* Stuff that isn't specifically authentication (e.g. user management)
